Description: LED controller for WS2811 strips
Version: 1.0
Author: Jeremy Peake

Project Overview:
An LED controller for WS2811 strips, based on the ESP-WROOM-32 devkit module using the Arduino framework in PlatformIO. This is specifically for an LED strip used in a feature planter at the top of a stairwell. The planter is a rectangle about 3m by 0.5m, and a continuous LED strip running arount the inside of it.

Goals:
- Designed to control a single strip of WS2811 LEDs, using up to 1000 per strip.
- Has a WiFi accessed web interface to control the strip, including the ability to add the unit to the home network while not currently connected to a network.
- Has a MQTT interface to Home Assistant.
- Has basic color and brightness control.
- Has some selactable effects which would suit the planter setup well.
- Has a water ripple effect which should make it appear as though the planter is filled with water.
- May use exisitng Arduino libraries for any of the required features.

Steps:
- Create a new project in PlatformIO
- Add the ESP-WROOM-32 devkit module
- Add the WS2811 library
- Add the MQTT library
- Add the WiFi library
- Add the ESPAsyncWebServer library
- Add the AsyncMqttClient library
- Create a Home Assistant discovery entry
- Create a MQTT discovery entry for Home Assistant
